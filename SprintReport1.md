## What's New (User Facing)
 * Create frontend
 * Create backend
 * Create database

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In this sprint we worked on creating our frontend, backend, and database. The frontend is developed using HTML, Javascript, and CSS for a web application. The backend was developed using Flask, a backend python framework, for our frontend to make requests to. We are using PostgreSQL as our database since it has quick searches which is important for our app.
