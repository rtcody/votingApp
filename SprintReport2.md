## What's New (User Facing)
 * Account Creation
 * Frontend user creation
 * Backend creation
 * Database user creation

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In this sprint we worked on creating our frontend which is setting up pages like login and sign up page, prompt creation page, and the home page
using HTML, Javascript, and CSS for a web application. The backend was developed using Flask, a backend python framework, and we implemented logic 
fetching data to store it in the database for user's data, storing polls within our poll's database like poll name, date created and when it expires
and poll id.
